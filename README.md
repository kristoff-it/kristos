A minimal OS implemented following "Operating system in 1000 lines of code"


## Status
Completed everything from the book except Disk I/O which I don't plan to do.

Zig must be version 0.13.0, but it's possible to use 0.14.0 by just fixing a single line of the source code.

Depends on llvm-objcopy, but would be possible to remove that dependency once 
Zig's own objcopy becomes feature complete enough.
